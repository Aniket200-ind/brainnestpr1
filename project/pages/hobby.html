                I love to ride bikes. I just enjoy to go on a long tour or journey on bikes. Riding just soothes and
                relaxes my mind, it feels very peaceful while I ride alone. My favorite and my dream bike is BMW's
                S1000RR. I just love this bike. I will do own it one day.</p>

            <p>
                I love to be with animals and enjoy their company. I love cats the most. There have been 10 cats that I
                have took care of. I also love to play with street dogs. Sometimes, I like to spend my time with animals
                rather than people.

                I love to play computer games a lot. I have been playing since 8 years. And it just feels good to that experience. 
                People do tell me that I should not play games, but I have gone through situations where these games have increased my concentration power. 
                For this, I also play games during my exams for an hour to increase my concentration and also it helps me when I feel lone and bored.
